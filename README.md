# 🌌 Dimensions Web Experience

## Overview
Welcome to the **Dimensions Project**, an interactive journey through the **1st to 5th dimensions** — built as two interconnected web experiences:
1. A **Conceptual Website** explaining each dimension in a visually engaging way.  
2. A **Simulation Website** where users can *experience* the dynamics of each dimension through interactive models.

## 🚀 Project Structure

### 1️⃣ The Informative Site – *“Dimensions Explained”*
**Purpose:**  
Designed to educate and visually narrate the meaning of 1D through 5D.  

**Features:**
- 🌐 Simple, clean interface that progressively expands from line to hypercube.  
- 📖 Textual + visual breakdowns of each dimension.  
- 🎨 Illustrations, motion graphics, and minimal UI transitions to represent dimensional growth.  
- 🧠 Ideal for learning, visualizing, and sharing fundamental dimensional concepts.

**Tech Stack:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or Framework)
- Lightweight animations (GSAP / Framer Motion)
- Responsive and mobile-friendly

### 2️⃣ The Simulation Site – *“Dimensions in Motion”*
**Purpose:**  
To simulate and visualize the behavior of objects, motion, and interactions across dimensions.  

**Features:**
- 🌀 Real-time dimensional simulations — lines (1D), planes (2D), cubes (3D), time layers (4D), and consciousness/possibility fields (5D).  
- ⚙️ User controls: zoom, rotate, manipulate, and transition between dimensions.  
- ⏳ Dynamic rendering of higher-dimensional projections.  
- 🔮 Great for exploration, experimentation, and creative visualization.

**Tech Stack:**
- Three.js / WebGL for 3D and higher-dimensional rendering  
- Physics engine for motion dynamics (e.g., Cannon.js)  
- Smooth UI with Tailwind / React for control panels

🌠 Vision

The goal is to bridge education and experience — not just telling people what dimensions are, but letting them feel the jump from a line to a tesseract to an infinite field.

This isn’t just a website. It’s a peek into how we perceive space, time, and beyond.
An experiment in dimensional empathy.
